# WordWeaver

Android app written in Java that started as my submission for the October 2017 HackUPC hackathon event.

Consists on a pseudorandom word generation, mainly catered towards conlangers, fantasy or sci-fi writers, or other people in need to create or simulate a fantasy language.

Moved to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/vylion/WordWeaver).
